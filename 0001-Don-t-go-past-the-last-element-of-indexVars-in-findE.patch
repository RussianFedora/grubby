Subject: [PATCH 01/10] Don't go past the last element of indexVars in
 findEntryByPath

We add a chance of creating an infinite loop, because we
were reading memory past the last element of indexVars set to -1.

This issue was only apparent with -O2, probably because the way the
memory was initialized.
